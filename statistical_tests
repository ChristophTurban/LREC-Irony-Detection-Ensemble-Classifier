Difference in results of Bertweet in the binary classification task when trained on Task A and Task B:
As seen in Table the average f1 score for classification of Task A lies at 0.7471. In comparison, the average f1 score when results of models which were trained on Task B were converted to the binary classification lies at 0.7804 (see Table 2).
A Shapiro-Wilk test applied on the f1 scores from the models which were trained on Task A showed a significant departure from normality, W(9)= 0.6020, p < 0,0001.
A Wilcoxon signed-rank test was conducted to compare these results.
It shows a significant difference in f1 scores of models trained on A (Mean: 0.7471 SD: 0.0559) and models trained on B (Mean: 0.7804 SD: 0.0117); Z = 8.0, p = 0.0488. 
This means that BERTweet performed significantly better on the binary classification task when trained on the multiclass classification task

Results for other statistical tests are available on request, they show no significance.
